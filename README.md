# Perfume-add-card
Challenge from front-end Mentor. My second challenge.

I got really far on my own with this challenge, but I got stuck at changing the images when going from mobile to desktop and my white container stayed really big. Or my image didn't fit into the container anymore.
Eventually I watched the tutorial on youtube from Kevin Powell and learned a lot more.

I put comments in my code to indicate which elements I got from the tutorial. Where there is no comment I did the code by myself.

What do I still need to learn: 
- I am going to deep dive in Flexbox and grid, because that is still very hard. 
- I am still a real newbie, there are lots of things I don't know yet, but I wanted to start practicing as much as possible with the things I already do know, 
the clip, clip-path didn't ring any bells yet, so I am going to study up on that as well.
